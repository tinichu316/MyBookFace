# Description
MBF is a digital experience that seeks to simulate the frustrations many experience while registering for an account. Of course, no actual information is recorded so please treat the game as a game rather than as a website.

### Built in C# using the Unity Engine
The program requires you to download the MBF 1.2.2 html and unity3d files, place them into the same folder, then launch the html file. An Internet browser that can run the Unity web plug-in, such as Mozilla firefox or Internet Explorer, is required to play.
